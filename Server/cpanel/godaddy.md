Deploying a GitHub private repository project to a GoDaddy cPanel subdomain involves several steps. Please note that not all GoDaddy hosting plans support SSH access, so you may need to check your hosting plan and contact GoDaddy support if you encounter any issues. Here's a step-by-step guide with code and the process:

### 1. Set Up SSH Key:

Before you can access your private GitHub repository from your GoDaddy hosting environment, you need to set up SSH keys.

#### a. Generate an SSH key pair on your GoDaddy cPanel:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
#### b. Add the public key to your GitHub account:

Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys.
Click on "New SSH key" and paste the content of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file.
### 2. Access Your GoDaddy Hosting Environment:

Use an SSH client like PuTTY or the terminal to connect to your GoDaddy hosting environment using SSH:

```bash
ssh your_username@your_domain.com
```
### 3. Clone Your GitHub Repository:

Navigate to the directory where you want to deploy your project, typically a subdomain directory in your cPanel, and clone your GitHub repository using the SSH URL:

```bash
cd public_html/subdomain_folder
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
```
### 4. Configure Git Remotes:

Change into your project directory and configure the Git remote to point to your GitHub repository:

```bash
cd your-repo
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo.git
```
### 5. Pull the Code:

Pull the code from your GitHub repository into your GoDaddy hosting environment:

```bash
git pull origin master
```
### 6. Configure Your Application:

Depending on your project, you may need to configure environment variables, set up a database connection, or configure any application-specific settings.

### 7. Set Up Automatic Deployment (Optional):

For continuous deployment, you can set up webhooks or use deployment scripts to automatically pull changes from GitHub whenever there's a push to your repository. This is especially useful for keeping your production environment up to date.

### 8. Testing:

Access your subdomain in a web browser to ensure your project is functioning as expected.

Please note that GoDaddy's hosting environment may have some limitations depending on your hosting plan, and the availability of SSH access may vary. If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, it's advisable to reach out to GoDaddy support for assistance with deploying your GitHub private repository to your cPanel subdomain.
