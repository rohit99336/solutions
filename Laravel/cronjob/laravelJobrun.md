To run a job added to the Laravel scheduler (`Kernel`), you need to ensure the Laravel scheduler is correctly set up and running. Here’s how to do it step by step:

---

### 1. **Verify the Job**
Ensure your job, `SendMessages`, implements the `ShouldQueue` interface and has the necessary logic in its `handle` method.

#### Example Job: `SendMessages`
```php
namespace App\Jobs;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class SendMessages implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    /**
     * Execute the job.
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        \Log::info('SendMessages job executed successfully!');
        // Add your message-sending logic here
    }
}
```

---

### 2. **Set Up the Scheduler Locally**
The Laravel scheduler is triggered by a cron job. For local development, you can run the scheduler manually or set up a cron job to trigger it.

#### Option 1: Run the Scheduler Manually
Run this command to manually trigger the scheduler:

```bash
php artisan schedule:run
```

This will execute all the scheduled tasks, including your job (`SendMessages`).

#### Option 2: Set Up a Cron Job (Optional for Production or Local Automation)
1. Open the crontab editor:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2. Add the following line to execute Laravel's scheduler every minute:
   ```bash
   * * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   Replace `/path-to-your-project` with the path to your Laravel application.

---

### 3. **Configure the Queue Worker (If Needed)**
If your job uses a queue (`ShouldQueue`), you must ensure the queue worker is running. Start the worker using:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

---

### 4. **Test the Scheduled Job**
1. Log the job's execution:
   In the `handle` method of the `SendMessages` job, log a message to verify it runs as expected.
2. Manually trigger the scheduler:
   ```bash
   php artisan schedule:run
   ```

3. Check the logs:
   Open `storage/logs/laravel.log` and look for the logged message:
   ```plaintext
   [2024-12-26 12:00:00] local.INFO: SendMessages job executed successfully!
   ```
4. Run job locally:
   ```bash
   php artisan schedule:work
   ```

---

### 5. **Verify Job Runs Automatically**
If you’ve set up the cron job for the scheduler, wait for it to trigger and verify the logs again.

---

### Debugging Tips
- Ensure the `QUEUE_CONNECTION` in your `.env` is set to `sync` for immediate execution or to `database`/`redis` for queued execution.
- Clear and restart the queue worker if the job is queued:
  ```bash
  php artisan queue:restart
  ```
