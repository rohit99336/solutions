Automating the deployment of a Laravel project on cPanel using GitHub involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Set Up Your GitHub Repository:

- Create a GitHub repository for your Laravel project if you haven't already.
- Push your Laravel project code to the GitHub repository.

### 2. Set Up cPanel:

- Make sure your cPanel hosting environment meets the Laravel project requirements (PHP version, extensions, etc.).
- Access cPanel and navigate to the "Git Version Control" or "Git" section (the exact name may vary depending on your hosting provider).

### 3. Create a Git Repository in cPanel:

- Create a new Git repository in cPanel and link it to your GitHub repository.

### 4. Set Up Deployment Hooks:

- In cPanel, navigate to the "Deployment" or "Webhooks" section.
- Add a new deployment hook, specifying the GitHub repository URL and selecting the branch to deploy.

### 5. Add Deployment Script:

- Create a deployment script (e.g., deploy.sh) in the root of your Laravel project.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Go to your Laravel project directory
cd /path/to/your/laravel/project

# Pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository
git pull origin master

# Install/update Composer dependencies
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

# Run database migrations and seed (if needed)
php artisan migrate --force

# Clear the cache
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache

# Set proper permissions (adjust as needed)
chmod -R 755 storage
chmod -R 755 bootstrap/cache

# Optimize the application
php artisan optimize

# Additional commands if needed (e.g., npm install, npm run production for frontend assets)
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

### 6. Configure Deployment Hook to Run the Script:

- In cPanel, edit the deployment hook to execute the deploy.sh script after each push.

### 7. Test Deployment:

- Make a change to your Laravel project, commit, and push it to the GitHub repository.
- Check the cPanel deployment logs for any errors.

### Notes:

- Ensure that cPanel allows the execution of shell scripts.
- Adjust the script and commands based on your Laravel project's specific requirements.
- Always backup your data before deploying changes in a production environment.

This setup allows for automated Laravel project deployment on cPanel whenever changes are pushed to the specified GitHub branch.
