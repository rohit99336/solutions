## ‚öôÔ∏è Scripts (In `composer.json`)

}

Run with:

composer run-script post-update-cmd
```

## üìÅ Important Files

* **`composer.json`** ‚Äì Lists required packages and metadata.
* **`composer.lock`** ‚Äì Locks the exact versions of installed dependencies.

Never edit `composer.lock` manually. Commit both files to version control.

Add custom repo in `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/your/package"
  }
]
```

## ‚úÖ Example Workflow

composer init                     # Initialize project
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle  # Add HTTP client
composer install                 # Install dependencies
composer dump-autoload           # Regenerate autoload files
