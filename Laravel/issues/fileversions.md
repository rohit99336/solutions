The `?v1` (or `?v=<version_number>`) in the CSS or JavaScript file URL is used to **force the browser to load the latest version of the file instead of using a cached version**. This technique is called **cache busting**.  

### **Why Use `?v` in Laravel or Any Web Page?**
1. **Prevents Browser Caching Issues:**  
   - Browsers cache static assets like CSS, JS, and images to speed up loading times.  
   - If you update `style.css`, the browser might still load the old cached version.  
   - Adding `?v1` makes the browser see it as a new file, forcing it to download the latest version.  

2. **Ensures Users Always Get the Latest Styles/Scripts:**  
   - If you modify `style.css`, change `?v1` to `?v2`, and the browser will fetch the updated file.  

3. **Better Performance Without Manually Clearing Cache:**  
   - Without versioning, users might need to manually clear their browser cache.  
   - Versioning automatically invalidates the cached file when the version number is changed.  

### **Best Practices for Versioning in Laravel**
Instead of manually updating `?v1`, you can use Laravel's `filemtime()` function to dynamically update the version based on the file's last modification time:

```blade
<link href="{{ asset('tmplates/politian/assets/sass/style.css') }}?v={{ filemtime(public_path('tmplates/politian/assets/sass/style.css')) }}" rel="stylesheet">
```

#### **How It Works:**
- `filemtime(public_path('tmplates/politian/assets/sass/style.css'))` gets the last modified timestamp of the file.  
- When the file is updated, the version number changes automatically (e.g., `style.css?v=1700000000`).  
- No need to manually update the version after every change! ðŸš€
