The `unisharp/laravel-filemanager` package is a popular file manager for Laravel, but sometimes issues can arise where files do not show up in the file manager interface. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. **Ensure Proper Installation and Configuration**

1. **Install the package** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    composer require unisharp/laravel-filemanager
    ```

2. **Publish the configuration files**:
    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lfm_config
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lfm_public
    ```

3. **Update `.env`**:
    Ensure your `.env` file includes these settings:
    ```env
    FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=public
    ```

4. **Configuration File**:
    Open `config/lfm.php` and check the following settings:
    - Set the correct disk:
      ```php
      'disk' => 'public',
      ```
    - Ensure paths are set correctly:
      ```php
      'base_directory' => 'public',
      'images_folder_name' => 'photos',
      'files_folder_name'  => 'files',
      ```

### 2. **Set Up Storage Symlink**

Ensure you have created a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public` by running:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 3. **Permissions**

Ensure the storage directories have the correct permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 public/storage
```

### 4. **Routes**

Ensure the routes are set up correctly in your `web.php`:
```php
Route::group(['prefix' => 'laravel-filemanager', 'middleware' => ['web', 'auth']], function () {
    \UniSharp\LaravelFilemanager\Lfm::routes();
});
```

### 5. **Check File Visibility**

Sometimes files might not show up due to visibility settings. Ensure the files have the correct visibility:
```bash
php artisan tinker

>>> Storage::disk('public')->allFiles();
```
This will list all files in the `public` disk. If your files are not listed, ensure they are in the correct directory and have the right permissions.

### 6. **Clear Cache**

Clear Laravel’s cache and config cache:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

### 7. **Debugging**

Check the browser console for any errors. Sometimes issues can be related to JavaScript or AJAX requests failing.

### 8. **Update Laravel File Manager**

Ensure you are using the latest version of `unisharp/laravel-filemanager`. Update the package if needed:
```bash
composer update unisharp/laravel-filemanager
```

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how your `config/lfm.php` should look for basic setup:
```php
return [
    'use_package_routes'       => true,

    'middlewares'              => ['web', 'auth'],

    'allow_private_folder'     => true,

    'allow_shared_folder'      => false,

    'user_field'               => 'id',

    'base_directory'           => 'public',

    'images_folder_name'       => 'photos',
    'files_folder_name'        => 'files',

    'valid_image_mimetypes'    => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'],
    'valid_file_mimetypes'     => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'application/pdf'],

    'max_image_size'           => 5000,
    'max_file_size'            => 10000,
];
```

### Additional Checks

- **Browser Console Errors**: Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors or failed network requests when accessing the file manager.
- **Laravel Logs**: Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for any errors related to the file manager.
- **Server Configuration**: Ensure your server configuration (e.g., Apache or Nginx) is correctly serving the public directory.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with `unisharp/laravel-filemanager` not showing files. If the problem persists, consider checking the package’s GitHub issues page for any similar issues or updates.
