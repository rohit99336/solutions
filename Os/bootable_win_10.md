Got it! You want to **write a Windows ISO directly to a USB drive** using the **Ubuntu terminal**‚Äîwithout any GUI or extra tools like WoeUSB. This **can be done using `dd`**, but there are **limitations**:

* `dd` **will not make a fully bootable USB** for all versions of Windows (especially UEFI ones), but it may work for **older BIOS-based installs**.
* For **modern Windows (10/11)** UEFI bootable drives, using `WoeUSB` or `Ventoy` is more reliable.

That said, here‚Äôs how to do it **entirely with the terminal** using `dd`:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This will **erase all data** on the USB drive. **Double-check** the USB device path (`/dev/sdX`)!

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Using `dd` to write Windows ISO to USB

### 1. **Insert your USB drive and find the device path**

```bash
lsblk
```

Find your USB, e.g., `/dev/sdb`.

---

### 2. **Unmount the USB**

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdX*
```

---

### 3. **Write the ISO file to the USB using `dd`**

```bash
sudo dd if=/path/to/windows.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
```

Replace:

* `/path/to/windows.iso` ‚Üí your actual ISO path
* `/dev/sdX` ‚Üí your USB device (not a partition like `/dev/sdb1`)

> Example:

```bash
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/Win10.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
```

This will take a few minutes depending on USB speed.

---

### 4. **Flush and eject**

```bash
sync
sudo eject /dev/sdX
```

---

## ‚ùå Limitations of `dd` Method

* **Most Windows ISOs will not boot properly on UEFI systems** this way because the ISO layout doesn't match the USB boot expectations.
* If you try to boot and it fails, it's due to the ISO expecting special bootloaders like EFI, which `dd` doesn't configure.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Alternative: Use `Ventoy` (also terminal-based)

Ventoy is a USB tool that creates a multiboot USB. You just copy ISO files onto the USB after installing Ventoy.

### 1. **Install Ventoy**

Download the Linux tarball from:
üëâ [https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html)

Extract and install:

```bash
tar -xvf ventoy-x.x.xx-linux.tar.gz
cd ventoy-x.x.xx
sudo ./Ventoy2Disk.sh -i /dev/sdX
```

Then simply copy your `Win10.iso` to the USB stick:

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/Win10.iso /media/$USER/Ventoy/
```

Reboot and boot from USB ‚Äî it works on both BIOS and UEFI systems.

Let me know if you want to proceed with `Ventoy`, or want to troubleshoot `dd` boot issues.
